# CloseCans

[Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/closecans) | Built for [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com)

The app finds waste bins close to the user's current location and plots them on an easy-to-navigate map. We store bin locations and bin types (trash, recycling, compost) in a MySQL db. In addition, we've created a form page where users can note any public trashcans that aren't already on the app.
